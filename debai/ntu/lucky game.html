<p><strong>Ch</strong>ú ý: bộ test do mình make(có thể có lỗi), không phải bộ test chính thức của kì thi</p>

<p>Thanh likes lucky games and today he is playing a new game: First he will be given 2 numbers A, B. There are B-A+1 boxes and each box is marked with a distinct number from A<strong> </strong>to B. Each box contains some balls, there are 2 colors of ball: black and white. The number of black and white balls in each box is depended on its marked number. Precisely, assuming that a box is marked with number V, if we convert number V into its binary presentation and remove any leading zero bits, then the number of 1-bits equals to the number of black balls and the number of 0-bits equals to the number of white balls. For example, a box marked with number 4 contains 1 black ball and 2 white balls as its binary presentation is 100.</p>
<p>The rule is simple: First Thanh randomly choose a box among B-A+1 boxes, after that he randomly choose a ball inside that box. If that ball is black then he wins, otherwise he loses. Thanh wants to know the probability that he can win this game.</p>
<p><strong>Input</strong></p>
<p>Input starts with the number of tests - T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100). Then T tests follow. Each test consists of 2 numbers Aand B (1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 10<sup>18</sup>)</p>
<p><strong>Output</strong></p>
<p>For each test in the input, output the probability that Thanh can win, with exactly 3 digits after decimal place.</p>
