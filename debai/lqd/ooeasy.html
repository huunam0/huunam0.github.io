<div><p>Oo loves solving problems so much. One day in \(14\) quarantine days, Oo met a challenging problem: “ Given  points on the Oxy plane: the coordinate of the \(i\)-th point is \((2019-a_i, 2a_i)\) Find two points having the largest distance among all pairs of points and print square of that distance.”</p>
<p>After 10 tireless days of researching, Oo finally came up with the formula of distance between two points on the Oxy plane. In case you may not know, Oo gladly shows you now: The square of distance between point \((x, y)\) and \((a, b)\) is \((x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2\). From that genius idea, Oo coded a genius solution. Unfortunately, the code is too long to write here but Oo still proudly tells you the core idea: Checking all pairs of points and finding the optimal pair. The formula’s proof and coding part are left as exercises for the reader!</p>
<p>Shockingly, Oo realized that the problem’s constraint is \(n \leq 10^5\). But like the last time, it didn’t take Oo a long time to think of another genius idea: randomization algorithm. Sound scary? Don’t worry! Oo’s new solution is here for you: Choosing \(k\) out of \(n\) points randomly and using the above code for those  points. But how do we choose ? Well, after \(9954\) experiments, Oo can confidently tell you that \(k\) should not exceed \(5000\).</p>
<p>Not too surprise, Oo sees the code giving wrong answers sometimes. But it does not matter since Oo has finished this challenging problem. Now it’s your opportunity to apply your learned skills and lessons from Oo’s problem-solving process. Here is your practice problem: Find the expected printing value of Oo’s above code. Too easy, right? Don’t worry! Oo won’t give you any hint to keep your joy of problem-solving intact.</p>
<h4>Input</h4>
<p>The first line of the input contains 2 positive integers \(n, k \ (1 \leq n \leq 10^5, 1 \leq k \leq min(5000, n))\) – the \(n\) and \(k\) in Oo’s code.
The next line contains \(n\) integer numbers \(a_i \ (1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9) \), the information of points.</p>
<h4>Output</h4>
<p>Print one number, the expected printing value of Oo’s code. Oo lets you know that the value can be written in form \(P/Q\) (Is it considered a hint? If yes, Oo apologizes you). You need to print \(P \times Q^{-1} \mod 10^9+7\)</p>
<h4>Sample</h4>
<p>Input 1</p>
<pre><code>4 3
1 2 3 4</code></pre>
<p>Output 1</p>
<pre><code>500000036</code></pre>
<p>Input 2</p>
<pre><code>2 2
2 3</code></pre>
<p>Output 2</p>
<pre><code>5</code></pre>
<h4>Explanation:</h4>
<p>In the first sample, there are \(4\) different triples can be chosen:</p>
<ul>
<li>\((1, 2, 3)\): The points are \((2018, 2), (2017, 4), (2016, 6)\). The largest distance is between \((2018, 2)\) and \((2016, 6)\). Printing value is its square: \(2^2+4^2=20\).</li>
<li>\((1, 2, 4)\): Printing value is \(45\).</li>
<li>\((1, 3, 4)\): Printing value is \(45\).</li>
<li>\((2, 3, 4)\): Printing value is \(20\).</li>
</ul>
<p>The expected value is \((20+20+45+45) / 4\) = \(\dfrac{65}{2}\).</p>
